-   Your description of the problem and the practical impacts of solving it

if we can recognize dif fronts -> reg dif hand writing -> we can tranlate images to text -> text to voice -> validation


classifier is best:

    train time -> image to text translation needs to be fast, think of on the fly videos to text trasnlations 

    accuracy -> miss-pell is critical as it can convey the wrong message and defeat the purse of our solutoin
